# SchoolIM
Tt is the rebuild proprity.The last homework of my unversity peroid that is using android to *CREATE* an IM app which teachers and student can help each other.

## Start in 2018-03-05 Hometown spring
This proprity had some problem whit github token. So I just code in my computer instead of git.
## Rebuild in 2018-04-30 Beijing summer
I fix this token time consuming,so I can use AndroidStudio to handle my CODE with Github.
There is sogou-inc Internet ,I can see some knowlegdes in [developer.android.com](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) .
Exciting!
